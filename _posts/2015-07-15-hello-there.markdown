Welcome to my personal website! Here you can see my projects, resume, and my blog posts. I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying Software Engineering (Class of 2020). My blog will be a place for me write about my experiences in code, school, and life. These will be things that are interesting to me and, hopefully, to you. 

I hope to blog fairly regularly on here, if I have the time. If you're curious, this website was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which I always seem to spell wrong. The beautiful theme is [Polar Bear](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme), but modified slightly by me. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) hosts the site and you should check them out!.
