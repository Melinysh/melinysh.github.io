The first line of code I wrote for what would later become Rez Reader was written in May 2014. Since then, Rez Reader has had a great run, but today, I've removed Rez Reader from the App Store.

I had found out in early May of that year that I'd be attending WWDC in June and thought if I wanted to take full advantage of the week, I needed to generate questions. Starting a project seemed like the logical thing to do. At the time I was unhappy with the flaws I saw in feed reader applications and took that challenge on. In the process, I learned an incredible amount about Objective-C, Swift, Core Data and design. I was extremely proud of Rez when I launched it in October 2014, but now I see similarities between [Casey Liss' Fast Text](https://www.caseyliss.com/2014/12/13/fast-text-discontinued) and Rez. 

Rez Reader served it's main purpose to me, but it no longer accurately represents my abilities. 


## What made me decide this?

In mid-January, I had a phone interview with a NYC startup. About 10 minutes before it was scheduled to start, I received a crash log from [Crashlytics](https://try.crashlytics.com) about a new crash in Rez. I didn't think much about it until the call started. Turns out the interview had been using it and wanted to talk in detail about the app. He never did mention the crash, but instead critiqued it. He noted some visual and behaviour inconsistencies in the app and asked for explanations. I didn't have any, but diligently noted I'd look into it.

How did he know about Rez? I had it on my resume. After the interview, I became anxious. It dawned on me that Rez doesn't display my current skill level and I knew it had to go from my resume. After removing it from my resume, the broader thought of taking it down from the App Store followed.  

## Why not just rebuild it?

Instead of "sunsetting" Rez, it seems like I could continue to support it, refactor and redevelop it, but that would not be the best use of my time. At university, I have a busy schedule. Every week I have around 30 hours of class and more hours outside of class committed to assignments and homework. I want to work on exciting things when I do have the time. I want new challenges. The complete rebuild of Rez has no place in my schedule or in my interests. 

## Why not open source it?

I vividly remember the first time I tried to incorporate Swift into Rez. I was on the first floor of Moscone West just one day after Swift was announced. I dove immediately after some quick reading and I struggled to rewrite a simple class from Objective-C. The codebase of Rez is a timeline of my developer education. Some parts of it were a joy to write and make use of great design patterns, but there are enough hacks, workarounds, and straight up terrible code that surprises me every time it works. I see no value in open sourcing it. 

## Thanks
Thanks to anyone from around the world who downloaded and tried Rez. I hope you got some good use out of it and I believe it won't be the last app of mine you'll use.
