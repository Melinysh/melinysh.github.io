Hello there! I'm Stephen. I'm a Software Engineering (Class of 2020) student at the University of Waterloo.

{% include image.html img="me.png" title="Stephen Melinyshyn"	 %}   

My programming experience is heavily focused on Swift & Objective-C, but I also code in Python and Go. Outside of programming I enjoy photography, mountain biking and reading. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Melinysh), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.melinyshyn), [GitHub](https://github.com/Melinysh) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=430765821&trk=hp-identity-name). If you'd like to contact me directly, email me at stephen.melinyshyn@gmail.com. 

This is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with a modified version of the [Polar Bear](https://github.com/diezcami/polar-bear-theme/) theme.
