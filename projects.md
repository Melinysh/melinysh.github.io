Not everything that I am currently working on or have worked on is listed here.

## NearbEYE
### October 2015
NearbEYE is an augmented reality app for iOS that helps you explore the city of Waterloo through your smartphone. NearbEYE utilizes open data from the City of Waterloo to provide informative, relevant information instantly. The app shows you information about nearby locations in the direction you are currently looking through a custom algorithm. It won 3rd place at the City of Waterloo's [Codefest Hackathon](http://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/WaterlooCodefest.asp) and was created by [Aaron Cotter](http://aaroncotter.me/), Ethan Hardy, and myself. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Melinysh/NearbEYE).


## Meshwork
### September 2015
Meshwork is an iOS app that uses Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework to find people around you and makes it a breeze to add their contact info to your phone. Meshwork also allows you to see if there are people nearby that you know and displays all your peers in a beautiful graph. Meshwork requires no internet connection to function, unlike other contact sharing apps. It was created at [Hack The North](http://hackthenorth.com) by [David Tsenter](http://www.davidtsenter.com), [Jonathan Galaperin](http://jgalperin.github.io), [Sam Haves](http://shaves.tk), and myself. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Melinysh/Meshwork).

## MarketMesh
### August 2015
MarketMesh is an iOS app for local marketplaces built upon a peer-to-peer mesh network. It allows for an individual to list physical objects or services for sale and displays it to nearby peers. One such service that is built-in to the app is a wireless proxy service. The proxy service allows a device's data connection to be shared and rented through the peer-to-peer network to another device. This app was created at the [Tech Retreat Hackathon](http://techretreat.ca) by [Alex Tomala](http://atomala.com), [David Tsenter](http://www.davidtsenter.com), [Jonathan Galperin](http://jgalperin.github.io) and myself. In the 9 hours we had to implement this idea, we built a working prototype that also included the proxy service. MarketMesh won 1st place for its technical difficulty, creativity, and usefulness. 

## PyMake
### April 2015 - August 2015
PyMake is a Makefile generator written in Python. It currently works with C, C++, Go and Fortran projects. When experimenting with small C++ projects, I found it tedious to write a Makefile and to hard code the configuration and compiler flags for each project. PyMake was created to remedy this. PyMake uses variables to allow for easy reconfiguration at the command line and has support for `make install`, `make uninstall`, and `make clean`. You can view the source and download PyMake from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Melinysh/PyMake).

## WWDC 2015 Student Scholarship App
### April 2015
This is my winning application for [Apple's 2015 WWDC Student Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/). It is entirely written in Swift, except for one portion that was a small Objective-C game I made in 2014 (before Swift even existed). It is completely written by me; no third party libraries! I had the idea of creating a stacked card interface for awhile, but I was blown away with what I was able to accomplish. You can read about my WWDC experience [here](http://melinysh.me/wwdc,/apple,/swift/2015/07/27/wwdc-2015-experience.html). I have only updated the app to support Swift 2 and iOS 9 so that anyone in the future can launch and explore my app without trouble. The core functionality and content of the app remains the same as the day I submitted it. You can check it out on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Melinysh/WWDC-2015-Student-App).

## Project Clay
### Jan 2015 - May 2015
Project Clay is my personal server side service that recreates the removed Twitter [Activity](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/updating-trends-on-mobile) feature by collecting and deriving this same data and more (unfollows, unfavourites). Given your user ID, API keys and correct OAuth tokens, Project Clay will continuously scrape, store, and analyze Twitter data with a Mongo database. Complete data (user profile, user tweets, favourites, followers, and following) is collected for all users up to two degrees away and just user profiles for the third degree. You can read more about the project by seeing the sanitized [snapshot](https://github.com/Melinysh/Project-Clay).

## Sweatervest.club 
### Jan 2015 - June 2015
Sweatervest.club was a website created by a friend and I for a final project in my Chemistry class. The website had three main components: a chemistry specific calculator, links to Khan Academy videos, and PDFs of important class handouts. My friend wrote the calculator in Flash while I handled the rest of the website. Sweatervest.club had more than 3,600 page views, with most of them from Russia... We ran the website for one semester of the school term and was often recommended to other students by the Chemistry teacher. Of course, you see it for yourself on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Melinysh/Sweatervest.club).

## Rez Reader 
### June 2014 - May 2015
Rez Reader was my first iOS app on the App Store. It's a feed reader I created out of dissatisfaction with the existing offering of feed readers. I started it right after I attended WWDC 2014, where I was first introduced to Swift and met with designers about my ideas for the UI. It was through the development of this application that I learned Swift. Rez Reader was launched in early October 2014 and I have updated it multiple times since. It has been downloaded by users around the world and exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed my time working on Rez Reader, but it is no longer maintained as I want to move on to bigger things. Rez Reader is a free application available to [download from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rez-reader/id918257334?ls=1&mt=8).
