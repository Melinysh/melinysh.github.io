Not everything that I am currently working on or have worked on is listed here.

## PyMake
### April 2015 - Present
PyMake is a Makefile generator written in Python. It currently works with C & C++. PyMake solves the annoyance that I experienced regularly when experimenting with small C++ projects. I found it tedious to have to write a Makefile and to hard code the configuration and compiler flags for each project. From there, PyMake was born. PyMake uses variables to allow for easy reconfiguration at the command line and support for `make install`, `make uninstall`, and `make clean`. You can view the source or download PyMake from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Melinysh/PyMake). 

## WWDC 2015 Student Scholarship App
### April 2015
This is my winning application for [Apple's 2015 WWDC Student Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/). It is entirely written in Swift, except for one portion that was a small Objective-C game I made in 2014 (before Swift even existed). It is completely written by me; no third party libraries! I had the idea of creating a stacked card interface for awhile, but I was blown away with what I was able to accomplish. I'll save my time at WWDC 2015 for a future blog post. I have only updated the app to support Swift 2 and iOS 9 so that anyone in the future can launch and explore my app without trouble. The core functionality and content of the app remains the same as the day I submitted it. You can check it out on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Melinysh/WWDC-2015-Student-App).


## Sweatervest.club 
### Jan 2015 - June 2015
Sweatervest.club was a website created by a friend and I for a final project in my Chemistry class. The website had three main components: a chemistry specific calculator, links to Khan Academy videos, and PDFs of important class handouts. My friend wrote the calculator in Flash while I handled the rest of the website. Sweatervest.club had more than 3,600 page views, with most of them from Russia... We ran the website for one semester of the school term and was often recommended to other students by the Chemistry teacher. Of course, you see it for yourself on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/Melinysh/Sweatervest.club).

## Rez Reader 
### June 2014 - May 2015
Rez Reader was my first iOS app on the App Store. It's a feed reader I created out of dissatisfaction with the existing offering of feed readers. I started it right after I attended WWDC 2014, where I was first introduced to Swift and met with designers about my ideas for the UI. It was through the development of this application that I learned Swift. Rez Reader was launched in early October 2014 and I have updated it multiple times since. It has been downloaded by users around the world and exceeded my expectations. I enjoyed my time working on Rez Reader, but it is no longer maintained as I want to move on to bigger things. Rez Reader is a free application available to [download from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rez-reader/id918257334?ls=1&mt=8).
